# Signage
This project is being completed under the requirements of Web601.

 - It is written in node.js, react.js and express.js and connects to an sql database.
 - The required packages will not come uploaded to the repo, so you must `npm install` them.
 - A python-based proof of concept can be found in the relevant branch, and so can a development branch and a wireframe branch.

To run the project, `npm start` in one terminal, and `cd backend;node server.js` in a second terminal.
